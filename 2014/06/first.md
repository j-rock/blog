#Seminal post

##The plan
I thought it was about time to organize some thoughts into a blog.

##Warnings
* My mind is a wasteland of crap. You read this stuff on your own volition.
* My writing style can be vulgar, wordy, and poorly structured.
* This shit will be hella boring to unintended audiences.
* I like Haskell. There will be much Haskell.

##On Haskell
I ain't a category theorist but I don't gotta be one. Haskell's sweet:

* Lazy evaluation makes for sweet abstractions. See [gluing crap together.](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)
* Sweet abstractions means boilerplate is reduced: code can get straight to the point.
* Type inference (program safety + minimal programmer burden!)
* Type classes (because fuck you, Java Interface)
* Pretty syntax
